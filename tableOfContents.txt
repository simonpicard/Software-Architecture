2 Architectural Styles and Patterns
    Architectural views
        Layers
            Divide application in layers, interfaces between, same level of abqstraction and interation within
        Indirection layers
            Allow acessing to the sub-system where direct access in problematic using wrapper
        Pipes and Filters
            Divide task, eac subtask is a filter, linked flexibly by pipe, allow parralelsim
        Shared Repository
            Central data dn client
        Active Repository
            Shared repository which notify client of usefull change
        Blackboard
            Divide complex task, then each subtask is computed when new datas arrive, potentially executed by another one. Control component for coordination
    Adaptation and language extension
        Microkernel
            Allow the support of several versions of a system with a common architecture
        Reflection
            Store structural and behavioural aspect of the system in meta object, allowing to modify them without modifying the application object which query the meta object
        Interceptor
            Updates services of framework to handle domain evolving
        Interpreter
        Virtual Machine
        Rule-based System
            Rule-base
            Working memory
            Engine
    User interaction
        Model View Control
        Presentation Abstract Control
            MVC divided using tree of agents
    Basic component Interaction
        Explicit Invocation
            Fire and Forget
            Syn with Server
            Poll Object
            Result Callback
        Implicit Invocation
            Client does not initiate the invocation
    Component Interaction and Distribution
        Client-Server
        3-tier Client-Server
            Dividing datas and application
        Peer-to-Peer
        Publish-Subscribe
            Observer like
        Broker
            communicate through different heterogeneous component, Requestor and Invoker side which have a marshaller to transform the datas

3 Aspect Oriented Software Development
    Software Complexity
        Accidental vs Essential
    Separation of Concerns
        Crosscutting Concerns
            Scattering
                one concerne to many region
            Tangling
                many concern to one region
        Dominant Decomposition
            Decomposing one problem makes other problem decomposition not possible
        Aspectual Decomposition
            Pointcut : Where
            Kind : When
            Advice : What
            Joinpoint : point where concern may be composed
                Model : define available joinpoint and their use
            Symmetric vs Asymetric
        Multidimensional SoC
    Design Patterns
        Observer
        Composite
        Flyweight
            Represent sequences of same objects with a unique instance per object (ex charactere in a text)
        Singleton
    
4 CBSD - SOA - AOSD
    Middleware and Components
        Component Bases Software Development

            Component Weight
                Fat - Lean
            Component Wiring
                Not component structure: Library, Framework
                Component structure: plug and play, glue code
            Middleware
                component-connector
                select and wire vs interface mismatches
